> ðŸŒŒ Cool hues meet quiet light â€” like early dawn over still water.

<i>Aurora Mist Levels</i> brings the calm of northern skies into your workspace. Deep navy and teal flow into soft aqua, pale green, warm cream, and blush pink â€” a balance between night and day, cold and warmth.

<i>Night fades into bloom â€”<br>
Green whispers through quiet light,<br>
Blush dawn takes its turn.</i> ðŸŒŒ
