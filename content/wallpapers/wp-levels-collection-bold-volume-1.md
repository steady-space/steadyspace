<p class="tagline"><strong>✨ Three moods of nature, one bundle.</strong></p>

<!-- description -->
<p>Some screens need calm — others thrive on energy. <em>Levels Collection: Bold Vol. 1</em> was created for the latter, bundling three unapologetically vibrant packs:</p><br>

🎨 <em>Retro Wave</em> → flowing gradients of aqua and reef blue for refreshing clarity<br>
🔥 <em>Ember Glow</em> → grounded greens and moss tones for balance + focus<br>
⚡ <em>Electric Pulse</em> → soft creams, ambers, and dusky purples for warm evening glow<br><br>

<p>From vaporwave gradients to fiery ember warmth to neon cyberpunk intensity, this collection delivers color and contrast.</p>

Fire meets pulse in midnight skies,<br>
Bold nights come alive.</i> 🌃
